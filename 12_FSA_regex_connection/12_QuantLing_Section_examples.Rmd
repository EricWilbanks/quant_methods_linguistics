## 1. Goals for Section

1. HW4 Overview
1. Compiling Images in RMD
1. FSA and Regex Practice 

## 2. Other Questions?

## 3. HW4 Overview

Let's look through HW4; what questions do you have? Some of them we'll get to during section examples.

## 4. draw.io

You can create your FSAs however you want (even on paper and take a picture of it!); I'd suggest using draw.io.

**Let's look at an example**

![Example 1](./fsa_pngs/example1.png)


1. Let's open the draw.io file and talk about making edits and saving
1. Let's discuss how we can embed images into .rmd files:
  - ```![Caption](file_path.png)```
  
```{r, class.source='example'}
# see the 12_QuantLing_Section.mp4 video for the explanation of using draw.io and embedding images int .rmd files
# time: 9:20-12:24

# you *don't* need to use rmd for this hw or use draw.io, but make sure you do save your images in your assignment!
```

3. What transition matrix does Example 1 correspond to?

```{r, class.source='example'}
delta <- matrix(rbind(c('q1','q0','-','-','-'),c('-','-','q2','-','-'),c('-','-','-','q2','q3'),c('-','-','q0','-','-')), nrow = 4, dimnames = list(c("q0","q1","q2:","q3"),c("a","b","c","d","e")))
print(delta)
```

4. What regular expression does Example 1 correspond to?

```{r, class.source='example'}
# /b*acd*(ecb*acd*)*/
```

## 5. Challenging Examples

**Draw an FSA which corresponds to the following matrix (start state is q0):**

```{r}
delta <- matrix(rbind(c('q1','q0','q3','-'),c('q1','-','q2','-'),c('-','q2','-','-'),c('-','-','-','q2')), nrow = 4, dimnames = list(c("q0","q1","q2:","q3"),c("a","b","c","d")))
print(delta)
```

***

**What Regular Expression corresponds to the FSA you made?**

```{r, class.source='example'}
# /b*(a+c|cd)b*/
```

***
 
**Draw an FSA for each of the following regular-expressions:**

2. /da+/

![5.2](./fsa_pngs/5_2.png)


***

3. /(da+)+/

![5.3](./fsa_pngs/5_3.png)

***

4. /(da+)(bda+)/

![5.4](./fsa_pngs/5_4.png)

***


5. /((da+)(bda+))|(da*)/
