## 1. Goals for Section

1. HW4 Overview
1. Compiling Images in RMD
1. FSA and Regex Practice 

## 2. Other Questions?

## 3. HW4 Overview

Let's look through HW4; what questions do you have? Some of them we'll get to during section examples.

## 4. draw.io

You can create your FSAs however you want (even on paper and take a picture of it!); I'd suggest using draw.io.

**Let's look at an example**

![Example 1](./fsa_pngs/example1.png)


1. Let's open the draw.io file and talk about making edits and saving
1. Let's discuss how we can embed images into .rmd files:
  - ```![Caption](file_path.png)```
3. What transition matrix does Example 1 correspond to?
3. What regular expression does Example 1 correspond to?

## 5. Challenging Examples

**Draw an FSA which corresponds to the following matrix (start state is q0):**

```{r}
delta <- matrix(rbind(c('q1','q0','q3','-'),c('q1','-','q2','-'),c('-','q2','-','-'),c('-','-','-','q2')), nrow = 4, dimnames = list(c("q0","q1","q2:","q3"),c("a","b","c","d")))
print(delta)
```

**What Regular Expression corresponds to the FSA you made?**

**Draw an FSA for each of the following regular-expressions:**

1. /da+/
1. /(da+)+/
1. /(da+)(bda+)/
1. /((da+)(bda+))|(da*)/
