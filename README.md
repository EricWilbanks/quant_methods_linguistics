# Quantitative Methods in Linguistics
Lecture notes and practice exercises from a course on Quantitative Methods in Linguistics.

These materials were originally developed by Eric Wilbanks for the discussion sections of the Spring 2020 UC Berkeley course "Quantitative Methods in Linguistics" taught by Dr. Jesse Zymet.


## Overview

Each week contains HTML and RMarkdown files for the materials with example exercises not filled out (default) and with example answers ("\_examples").

Week 04 is intentionally skipped.

Finally, supplementary datasets and images are included in `supplementary_files`. References to these files in the `.rmd` files must be updated to be correctly accessed.
